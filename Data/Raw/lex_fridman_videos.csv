This episode is available in both English and Spanish.
Thank you for listening ❤ Check out our sponsors: https://lexfridman.com/sponsors/ep453-sb
See below for timestamps, transcript, and to give feedback, submit questions, contact Lex, etc.

*Update: 3rd Audio Track with Original Audio:* 
I've added a 3rd audio track with the original audio, with Lex speaking English and Javier Milei speaking Spanish. To listen to it, please choose ""English (United Kingdom)"" audio track, by clicking on: Settings (Gear Icon), Audio Track, Choose: English (United Kingdom). So, ""English (US)"" is the fully english dubbed track, and ""English (UK)"" is the original bilingual track. For the latter, you can turn on subtitles as well. For now, this is the best I can do. I will work with the YouTube team to figure out a better solution. I tried really hard to make this conversation as accessible as possible to people who speak only English or Spanish. I'll keep trying to figure out how to do this better. Your feedback is deeply appreciated. Thank you for listening. I love you all! ❤

*Corrections/Clarifications in Translation:* 
- The English translation at 23:23 says ""fiscal deficit"" when it should say ""fiscal balance"". We fixed the captions, transcript, and will try to fix the audio soon 🙏
- A few times ""liberal"" is mentioned. In most of the world (except US) that means ""classical liberal"" which in US is better understood as ""libertarian"". 

*Switch between English & Spanish Versions:*
This podcast is translated and dubbed into Spanish. To switch between English & Spanish, click: Settings (Gear Icon) , Audio Track , Choose Language.

Thank you to ElevenLabs for their amazing help with translation & dubbing 🙏'

The purpose of this trip is to celebrate nature at its purest and most intense, and to celebrate the work of people like Paul who have dedicated their life to protecting the jungle and the endless diversity of life that calls it home.

If you want to support Paul and his work, please donate or reach out to Junglekeepers:
https://www.junglekeepers.org

I hope to get back in one piece, and have some stories to tell. I'll try to record a podcast with Paul deep in the jungle.

I'll be offline until I emerge out. Meanwhile, no internet, no phone, no connection to outside world. Just the raw, beautiful immensity of nature.

I'm truly grateful to be alive, to have gotten the chance to live on this beautiful planet of ours, with all of you, my fellow humans. I love you all ❤"
